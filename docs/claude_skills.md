# Claude Skills

Modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality through instructions, scripts, and resources loaded automatically when needed.

---

## What Are Skills?

Skills are folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions and optional resources. Claude automatically detects when to use them‚Äîno manual invocation needed.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Composable**: Stack multiple skills together
- **Portable**: Work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and API
- **Efficient**: Only load content when needed
- **Powerful**: Include executable scripts for reliable operations

---

## Skill Structure

```
skill-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SKILL.md           # Required: Main instructions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ REFERENCE.md       # Optional: Additional docs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EXAMPLES.md        # Optional: Usage examples
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/           # Optional: Executable code
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helper.py
```

### SKILL.md Format

Every skill requires YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Name

## Instructions
Step-by-step guidance for Claude on how to use this skill.

## Examples
Concrete usage examples.
```

**Field Requirements:**
- `name`: Max 64 chars, lowercase, hyphens only, no "anthropic" or "claude"
- `description`: Max 1024 chars, explain what it does and when to use it

---

## Three-Level Loading

Skills use progressive disclosure to avoid token bloat:

| Level | When Loaded | Content |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **1: Metadata** | Always (startup) | name + description (~100 tokens) |
| **2: Instructions** | When triggered | Full SKILL.md body |
| **3: Resources** | As needed | Referenced files, scripts, templates |

**Level 1**: Claude loads all skill names/descriptions at startup to decide when to use them.

**Level 2**: When triggered, Claude reads SKILL.md from filesystem into context.

**Level 3**: Claude reads additional files or runs scripts only when needed.

This allows unlimited bundled content without hitting token limits.

---

## How Claude Uses Skills

1. **Discovery**: Claude scans installed skills at startup (Level 1 metadata)
2. **Activation**: When task matches a skill's description, Claude loads SKILL.md (Level 2)
3. **Execution**: Claude follows instructions, reads additional files as needed (Level 3)
4. **Scripts**: Claude runs bundled scripts via bash‚Äîonly output enters context, not code

Skills activate automatically based on task relevance. You'll see skill activation in Claude's reasoning chain.

## Creating Skills

### Method 1: Use skill-creator Skill

Claude has a built-in skill that helps create new skills interactively:
1. Ask Claude to create a skill
2. skill-creator guides you through the process
3. Claude generates SKILL.md, folder structure, and bundles resources

### Method 2: Manual Creation

1. Create folder: `~/.claude/skills/your-skill-name/`
2. Create `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
3. Add instructions, examples, and optional resources
4. Restart Claude or reload skills

## Installation

### Claude Code

**From Marketplace:**
```bash
# Install from anthropics/skills
# Search for skills in Claude Code marketplace
```

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Create in ~/.claude/skills/
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/my-skill
cd ~/.claude/skills/my-skill
# Create SKILL.md file
```

**Project-Specific:**
```bash
# Install in project: .claude/skills/
mkdir -p .claude/skills/my-skill
cd .claude/skills/my-skill
# Create SKILL.md file
```

### Claude.ai

1. Go to Settings > Features
2. Upload custom skill as .zip file
3. Skill activates automatically

### API

Requires beta headers:
- `code-execution-2025-08-25`
- `skills-2025-10-02`
- `files-api-2025-04-14`

Upload via `/v1/skills` endpoint or reference pre-built skills by ID.

---

## Best Practices

**Start Simple**: Begin with clear instructions, add complexity as needed.

**Split Large Content**: Break unwieldy SKILL.md into referenced files (REFERENCE.md, FORMS.md).

**Use Scripts**: For deterministic operations (sorting, parsing), use Python/Bash scripts instead of token generation.

**Test Iteratively**: Observe how Claude uses the skill and refine based on real usage.

**Clear Description**: Write precise descriptions so Claude knows when to activate the skill.

---

## Pre-built Skills

Anthropic provides four ready-to-use skills:
- **pptx**: PowerPoint creation and editing
- **xlsx**: Excel spreadsheets and analysis
- **docx**: Word document creation
- **pdf**: PDF generation and formatting

---

## Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **Only install skills from trusted sources**

Skills can:
- Execute bash commands
- Read/write files
- Run Python scripts

**Before installing:**
- Audit all bundled files
- Review script code
- Verify no malicious operations
- Check for data exfiltration risks

---

## Limitations

- **No network access**: Skills cannot make API calls
- **No runtime installs**: Cannot install packages at runtime
- **No cross-platform sync**: Upload separately for each platform
- **Scoped to user/workspace**: Cannot share publicly

---

## Example: Simple Skill

```yaml
---
name: markdown-formatter
description: Format and structure markdown documents with consistent styling
---

# Markdown Formatter

## Instructions

When asked to format markdown:

1. Check for proper heading hierarchy (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3)
2. Add blank lines between sections
3. Format code blocks with language identifiers
4. Use consistent list formatting
5. Add horizontal rules between major sections

## Examples

**Input**: "Format this markdown file"
**Action**: Read file, apply formatting rules, write formatted version

## Reference Files

See FORMATTING_RULES.md for complete style guide.
