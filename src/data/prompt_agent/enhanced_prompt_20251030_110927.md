## Original Prompt

All right, so I want to build a game that reminds me of the old game where you shoot at hills and it blows up the little tanks. You know, like you angle the shooter thing and you go and then it throws or shoots the little ball through the air at the other tank. You have to make sure that you are pointing at the right height and doing the right power. Yeah, I want this built in Python and I want it to be very nice looking, good colors, fun, etc.

## Enhanced Prompt

You are an expert Python game developer specializing in creating engaging, visually appealing arcade-style games using Pygame. Your expertise includes physics simulations, particle effects, and creating polished user experiences.

## Task Overview
Create a tank artillery game reminiscent of classic "Scorched Earth" style games where players adjust angle and power to shoot projectiles at enemy tanks across destructible terrain.

## Core Requirements

### Game Mechanics
- **Two tanks** positioned on opposite sides of the screen
- **Destructible terrain** using procedural hill generation
- **Physics-based projectile motion** with gravity and arc trajectory
- **Turn-based gameplay** alternating between players
- **Angle and power controls** for each shot
- **Collision detection** for terrain and tanks

### Visual Design
- **Modern, attractive graphics** with smooth animations
- **Vibrant color scheme** with good contrast
- **Particle effects** for explosions and terrain destruction
- **Clean UI elements** showing current player, angle, and power
- **Visual feedback** for hits and misses

### Technical Implementation
- Use **Pygame** library for graphics and game loop
- Implement **efficient terrain deformation** using pixel manipulation or masks
- Create **smooth animations** at 60 FPS
- Include **sound effects** (optional but recommended)
- Add **wind effects** for increased challenge (optional)

## Code Structure Requirements

```python
# Main game class structure:
class TankGame:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize pygame, screen, colors, etc.
    
    def generate_terrain(self):
        # Create random hills using sine waves or noise
    
    def handle_events(self):
        # Process user input for angle/power adjustments
    
    def update(self):
        # Update physics, check collisions, handle turns
    
    def draw(self):
        # Render everything: terrain, tanks, UI, particles
    
    def run(self):
        # Main game loop
```

## Success Criteria
- Game runs smoothly at 60 FPS
- Terrain destruction works seamlessly
- Physics feel realistic and predictable
- Visual presentation is polished and engaging
- Code is well-organized and documented
- Game is fun and replayable

## Additional Features (Optional)
- Multiple weapon types
- AI opponent
- Score tracking
- Different terrain themes
- Power-ups or special abilities

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Focus on creating a complete, playable game with excellent visual appeal. The terrain destruction system is critical - make sure explosions actually remove parts of the landscape.
