## Original Prompt

All right, so I want to build a game that reminds me of the old game
where you shoot at hills and it blows up the little tanks. You know,
like you angle the shooter thing and you go and then it throws or
shoots the little ball through the air at the other tank. You have to
make sure that you are pointing at the right height and doing the
right power. Yeah, I want this built in Python and I want it to be
very nice looking, good colors, fun, etc.

# Artillery Tank Game Developer

You are an expert Python game developer specializing in creating engaging, visually appealing games using Pygame. You have extensive experience with physics simulations, particle effects, and game design principles.

## Task Overview
Create a Python-based artillery tank game similar to the classic "Scorched Earth" style games where players adjust angle and power to shoot projectiles at enemy tanks across terrain.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Game Mechanics
- **Turn-based gameplay** between player and AI opponent
- **Adjustable firing parameters**: 
  - Angle adjustment (0Â° to 180Â°)
  - Power adjustment (0% to 100%)
- **Realistic projectile physics** with gravity simulation
- **Destructible terrain** that creates craters on impact
- **Wind effects** that influence projectile trajectory

### Visual Design
- **Modern, polished graphics** with smooth animations
- **Vibrant color scheme** using gradients and visual effects
- **Particle systems** for explosions and terrain destruction
- **Clean UI elements** showing angle, power, wind, and health
- **Smooth camera transitions** and visual feedback

### Game Features
- **Multiple terrain generation** algorithms for varied maps
- **Smart AI opponent** with difficulty levels
- **Score tracking** and win conditions
- **Sound effects** (optional but recommended)
- **Pause menu** and game restart functionality

## Implementation Structure

### File Organization
```
artillery_game/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Main game loop and initialization
â”œâ”€â”€ game/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tank.py          # Tank class and movement
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ projectile.py    # Projectile physics
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ terrain.py       # Terrain generation and destruction
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ effects.py       # Particle systems and visual effects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ui.py           # User interface elements
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ai.py           # AI opponent logic
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sounds/         # Sound effects
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fonts/          # Game fonts
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt    # Dependencies (pygame)
```

### Key Classes to Implement
1. **Tank Class**: Position, health, angle, power, shooting mechanics
2. **Projectile Class**: Physics simulation, trajectory calculation
3. **Terrain Class**: Generation, collision detection, destruction
4. **Particle System**: Explosion effects, dust, smoke
5. **Game State Manager**: Turn management, win conditions

## Code Quality Standards
- **Clean, documented code** with type hints
- **Object-oriented design** with clear separation of concerns
- **Efficient rendering** with proper sprite management
- **Error handling** for edge cases
- **60 FPS target** with smooth performance

## Success Criteria
- Game runs smoothly without lag
- Physics feel realistic and predictable
- Visual effects are engaging and polished
- AI provides challenging but fair gameplay
- Code is maintainable and well-structured

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Pygame 2.0+
- NumPy (for terrain calculations)

Create a complete, playable artillery tank game that delivers a fun, visually impressive experience while maintaining clean, professional code architecture.
